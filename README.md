# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to be able to help students study the prework for the programming boot camp class. 
I built this project to help boot camp students study for the prework, by writing notes for different lessons of the prework and keeping it organized and neat on a webpage for the students to use.
This project solves the problem of any boot camp students who may be stressed about completing the prework, as it helps them study for the preowork and gives them some notes on the lessons.
While making this project, I learned many things. I learned how to write HTML code in with markup and structure a webpage. Then I learned how to code a CSS style sheet to make the webpage look nicer and introduce a style to the webpage. Lastly, I learned how to use JavaScript to make the website functional by adding content to the console of the webpage.
